# Binary ones length thing

*solving only the most real-world problems*

Given a number, Write a function that will return the largest sequence of 1's, of it's binary equivilent.

The input will ONLY contain numbers.

For example, the input 12 would return 2. This is because the binary of 12 is `1100`, and the largest sequence of 1s is the two next to eachother. 23 would return 3 because `10111` has three in sequence.

Negative numbers can not be binary, so return 0 if invalid.
