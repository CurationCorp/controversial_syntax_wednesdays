# Largest Square of 1s in a matrix

Given a 2d tensor of ones and zeros, find the area of the largest square of 1s contained within it. You can do this challenge in Python, Javscript, or both

For example:

        [[1]] => 1

        [[0,0,0,0],
        [0,1,1,0], => 4
        [0,1,1,0],
        [0,1,1,0]]

Test your JavaScript with `yarn test`
Test your Python with `python 003_largest_square/test_largest_square.py`
